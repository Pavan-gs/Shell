Data Redundancy
Breach of Security
Unstructured
Linear Search
Non Concurrent operations
CRUD operations take time

OLTP
--------

DataBases --> 

DBMS --> Hirarchical db's, Networking DB's, RDBMS

RDBMS
-----------

Pre-defined structure
Concurrent operations
Data redundancy is avoided

ACID properties
---------------------

Atomicity --> 
Consistency --> 
Isolation --> 
Durability --> 

Data Model --> Designing the basic functionality and structure of the data
ER Diagram --> Pictorial representation of the data model 
Cardinality --> Degree of relationship

Constraints
----------------

Keys --> 

Primary --> Unique, Not Null
Candidate Key --> Combination of more than one key to identify unique records 
Referential integrity(Foreign Keys) -->
Alternate Keys --> All the keys other than Primary keys

Not null
default
Unique
Check


OLAP
-------

Analytics --> Fetch data in columns rather than rows
Data warehousing [ETL]

Data from different sources are extracted, transformed into specific form(removing anamolies and unnecessary information) and loading it into 
Warehouse for analysis and produce reports & dashboards in BI tools.

BI tools --> Power BI, Qlikview, Tableau, Cognos, Lookr

NOSQL
----------

Schema on read
Unstructured
Horizontal scaling is easy

Columnar DB's --> Cassandra, Hbase
Document db's --> Mongodb
Key-value pairs, graphs

Big Data Challenges
---------------------------

By collecting, storing, managing and analysing Big Data, business can have better understanding and build data driven decision making systems

Volume --> Cost of storage [RDBMS --> Licensed, high end costly servers] --> Pre-mature death of data

Velocity --> Speed of data generation

Variety --> Unstructured data

Hadoop  --> Written in Java
----------- 

HDFS --> Storage layer
------------------------------

Name node (Master) --> Allocate the data nodes for storing blocks and replications
Data Node (Slave) --> Allow storage of blocks and replications

hadoop fs  -put /source_path /destination_path

fs (Client) takes the request from the user
fs devides the data into blocks of max 128 mb

Master (Name node) --> Takes the request from the FS, prepares a list of data nodes(slave machines) to store the data in blocks in parallel

The blocks are then devided into replications (3 by default) and written serially

300 mb file
b1r1,b1r2,b1r3
b2r1,b2r2,b2r3
b3r1,b3r2,b3r3

Rack Awareness
----------------------
High-availability --> Auto back-up
Federation --> Setting up multiple name nodes for data

Map-reduce  --> Processing layer  --> Parallel processing framework
-----------------
 Map class   --> Business Logic 
 Reduce Class --> Aggregation Logic

 Print the names of employees getting > 10k salary?
 Print the count of employees getting > 10k salary?

Hive --> Warehousing solution
------
Stores the metadata in a local db called metastore/derby


Cloud --> rent Infrastructure and pay as you go.

Cloud based managed services --> Storage, DBMS, Warehousing, ML, Pipeline, AI

Data Lifecycle
-------------------

Data Engineering --> Collection, storage, management & processing of data [RDBMS, Excel, DWH, Cloud]

Data Analysis --> EDA (summarising/profiling), data cleaning [Python, R, Excel, SAS]

Data Visualisation  / BI  --> Presentations, reports, charts, Dashboards [Power BI, Tableau, Qlikview]

Advanced Analytics --> Machine learning / Deep learning models


SQL Server on Azure
----------------------------

Managed RDBMS service by Microsoft

Availability, data safety, Built-in intelligence, Advanced security & compliance, Monitoring capacities


Managed Instance

Single db

Elastic pool

Data types
---------------
bit, tinyint, int, bigint, numeric, decimal --> Exact Numeric 
Read, float --> Approximate
Date & time --> date, datetime
Character --> Char & varchar
